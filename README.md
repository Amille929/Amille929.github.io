## About Me
I am a recent Linguistics and Spanish graduate from the University of Oregon, where I became involved in linguistic annotation at the Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science (LCR-ADS) lab.

Now that I have graduated, I plan to continue working with language. I hope to start a career in natural language processing or speech therapy. Other possibilities include graduate school and teaching English abroad. 

I am searching for work. Although I am currently employed part-time at the LCR-ADS lab, I work few hours and the projects I am involved with are coming to an end. I also believe it is important to leave opportunities at the lab open for current University of Oregon students.

My academic interests include phonology, syntax, semantics, corpus linguistics, applied linguistics, and Spanish. I am a published coauthor and my work has contributed to linguistic corpora for AI/ML models.
