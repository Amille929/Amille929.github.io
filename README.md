## About Me
I am a recent Linguistics and Spanish graduate from the University of Oregon, where I became involved in linguistic annotation at the Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science (LCR-ADS) lab ([link](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/LCR-ADS-Home/)).

I am moving to Reno, Nevada to begin work as a data annotation specialist for Microsoft starting May 8th. This is a huge development in my life and I am extremely grateful for this opportunity.

My academic interests include phonology, syntax, semantics, corpus linguistics, applied linguistics, and Spanish. I am a published coauthor and my work has contributed to linguistic corpora for AI/ML models.
