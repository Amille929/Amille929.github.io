## About Me
I am a recent Linguistics and Spanish graduate from the University of Oregon, where I became involved in linguistic annotation at the Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science (LCR-ADS) lab ([link](https://lcr-ads-lab.github.io/LCR-ADS-Home/)).

After graduating I moved to Reno, Nevada to begin work as a data annotation specialist at Microsoft AI Operations.

My academic interests include phonology, syntax, semantics, corpus linguistics, applied linguistics, and Spanish.
