## About me
I am a recent Linguistics and Spanish graduate from the University of Oregon, where I became involved in linguistic annotation at the Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science Lab. I am a published coauthor and my work has contributed to linguistic corpora for AI/ML models.

My academic interests include all things language, with an emphasis on include phonology, syntax, semantics, corpus linguistics, applied linguistics, and Spanish.
