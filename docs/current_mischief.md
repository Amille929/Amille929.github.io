## Current Mischief
I currently work as a linguistic annotator at the Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science Lab at the University of Oregon. I am working under PHD student Masaki Eguchi to create an engagement analyzer tool ([demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/egumasa/engagement-analyzer-demo)). This project will be presented at [AAAL 2023](https://www.aaal.org/events/aaal-2023-conference---portland-oregon) in Portland Oregon. I will be attending all days of the conference.

Now that I have graduated, I plan to continue working with language. I hope to start a career in natural language processing. Other possibilities include graduate school and teaching English abroad.
