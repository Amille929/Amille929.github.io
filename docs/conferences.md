## Linguistics Conferences

### American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) 2023
From January 2022 to March 2023, I worked under PHD student Masaki Eguchi at the University of Oregon LCR-ADS lab to create an engagement analyzer tool ([demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/egumasa/engagement-analyzer-demo)). This project was be presented at [AAAL 2023](https://www.aaal.org/events/aaal-2023-conference---portland-oregon) in Portland Oregon. I attended all days of the conference.

### North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) 2022
From April 2021 to February 2022, I worked under Associate Professor Kris Kyle as a linguistic annotator at the University of Oregon LCR-ADS lab to help create a corpus of spoken second language English. I was fortunate enough to coauthor the resulting paper ([link](https://aclanthology.org/2022.bea-1.7.pdf)) and receive a $500 conference travel award from the Center for Undergraduate Research and Engagement at the University of Oregon. I attended [NAACL 2022](https://2022.naacl.org/) in Seattle Washington to assist in the poster presentation of the project.
