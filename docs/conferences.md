## Linguistics Conferences

##### American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) 2023
Since January 2022, I have been working under PHD student Masaki Eguchi at the University of Oregon LCR-ADS lab to create an engagement analyzer tool ([demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/egumasa/engagement-analyzer-demo)). This project will be presented at [AAAL 2023](https://www.aaal.org/events/aaal-2023-conference---portland-oregon) in Portland Oregon. I will be attending all days of the conference.

##### Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2022
From April 2021 to February 2022, I worked under Associate Professor Kris Kyle as a linguistic annotator at the University of Oregon LCR-ADS lab to help create a corpus of spoken second language English. I was fortunate enough to coauthor the resulting paper ([link](https://aclanthology.org/2022.bea-1.7.pdf)) and receive a $500 conference travel award from the Center for Undergraduate Research and Engagement at the University of Oregon. I attended [ACL 2022](https://www.2022.aclweb.org/) in Seattle Washington to assist in the poster presentation of the project.
